The purpse for the application of the Event Tracker was to be able to have a list of 
the events for previous and future events into a database.  The user should be able to 
add and delete from this database.  Being able to log into your own account is also required.  The screens of this app included the log in screen were you can be directed to a sign up screen if you dont have an account yet.  The home screen that has the list of all the future events.  The add and update screens as well.  I did a lot of researching for this app as in looking into similar apps and into what works best.
